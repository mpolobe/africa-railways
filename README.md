**Connecting 54 Nations via High-Speed Rail & Sui Blockchain Technology.**

The Digital Spine is the world's first integrated infrastructure project combining heavy rail logistics with the **Sui Move Ledger**. By digitizing every freight ton and passenger ticket, we ensure a transparent, secure, and hyper-efficient trade corridor for the African continent.

## 📊 Project Ecosystem
* **Core Ledger:** Built on Sui for sub-second finality and logic-based assets.
* **Sentinel Network:** 2,000+ track workers incentivized via "Proof-of-Safety" rewards.
* **Economic Model:** A 1% burn flywheel on all transit transactions.
