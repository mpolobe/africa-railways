**Africa Railways Activates "The Digital Spine": A Sovereign Blockchain & AI Infrastructure for a Unified Continent**

**LUSAKA, ZAMBIA | December 18, 2025** — Africa Railways today announced the successful production launch of "The Digital Spine," a first-of-its-kind logistics infrastructure powered by the **Sui Blockchain** and **Digits AI**. 

By integrating real-time telemetry from locomotives across 54 nations into an Autonomous General Ledger (AGL), Africa Railways has created the world’s most transparent and efficient continental trade corridor.

### **The 1% Innovation**
The Spine features an automated "1% Treasury Burn" protocol. Every freight movement generates a micro-contribution toward a regional sovereign fund, managed on-chain and verified by **Digits AI**. This ensures that the infrastructure literally "builds itself" with every kilometer traveled.

### **Worker-First Technology**
Through the **Sentinel Mobile App**, over 2,000 field workers are now connected to the Spine. Using **zkLogin**, workers sign immutable safety manifests, triggering instant performance credits and safety bonuses categorized by the Digits AI finance agent.

### **Executive Quotes**
"The Digital Spine is not just about rail; it is about trust," said the Project Lead. "By merging the speed of Sui with the financial intelligence of Digits, we have removed the friction of cross-border trade for an entire continent."

**About Africa Railways:**
Africa Railways is the lead architect of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) digital logistics layer, dedicated to building sovereign, sustainable, and high-tech rail infrastructure.
